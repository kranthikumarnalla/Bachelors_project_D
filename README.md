# APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING AND BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTISE METHODSFOR FLOOD CONTROL MANAGEMENT IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS OF VIJAYAWADA

The primary goal of this project is to find out the flood inundation zones and to identify
the best BMP design to reduce runoff volume by infiltrating rainfall water to ground
water, evaporating rain water back to the atmosphere after storm and find the beneficial
uses rather than passing them in to streams as a waste product. 

AIM: 

• To implement BMP's for the flood prone areas in urban area (Krishna Lanka and Yenamalakudhuru) of Vijayawada.

OBJECTIVES: 

• To find out the inundation zones in the low laying urban areas of Vijayawada.

• To increase the ground water potential by enhancing the infiltration capability by permeable pavement in low-lying Vijayawada areas.

SCOPE: 

• To identify the flood prone areas using Remote sensing and GIS techniques.

• To trace flood prone areas in Vijayawada and its surrounding areas.

EXPECTED OUTCOME:

• To reduce the flood in urban areas and to increase ground water level by natural recharge.
